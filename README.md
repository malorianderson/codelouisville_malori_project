# codelouisville_malori_project

Design by Malori Anderson

Initially, I just wanted to use a hexagonal shape for the logo, which led me to the honeycomb design and theme. A lot of the bee websites out there are very informative and text heavy, making them not-so-user-friendly. This is my reasoning for making my site clean and modern.

I wanted to use a heavy left border as a design element, as well as incorprate the Pantone color of the year, Greenery. After designing the graphics, I settled on a consisent color scheme throughout the site. 

I started to incorporate flexbox as we started to learn flexbox in the course.

The home page has css effects, though the donate button is not interactive.

You can find that the logo is the home button, Retrieve & Recover takes you to the respective page, as well as the Bee Smart page.
(the donate page and species are just a tease)

My Javascript can be found on the "Bee Smart" page. 
You'll see that when you click on the button, it generates a random fact.

You'll find the Retrieve and Recover form, a hive svg(not created by me - I just changed the colors to match the color pallette). The form has various elements that occur via css, as well as a success alert that pops up when the form submit button is clicked.
